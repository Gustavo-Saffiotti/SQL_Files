Welcome to the SQL Files Repository! This repository houses a comprehensive collection of SQL scripts designed to cover a wide array of SQL functionality and best practices. It serves as a valuable resource for developers, database administrators, and anyone interested in mastering SQL.

Within this repository, you'll find examples of core SQL operations, including **Data Definition Language (DDL)**, **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**, **Data Control Language (DCL)**, and **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**. Additionally, you'll find more advanced features such as **Stored Procedures**, **Triggers**, and other commonly used database operations.

## Key Features

### 1. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**
   - Scripts for creating, altering, and dropping tables, views, and indexes.
   - Examples include schema creation, data integrity constraints, and altering table structures.

### 2. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**
   - Scripts for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data in tables.
   - Includes complex `SELECT` queries, `JOIN` operations, and `GROUP BY` usage.

### 3. **DCL (Data Control Language)**
   - Scripts for managing permissions and user access with `GRANT`, `REVOKE`, and `DENY`.
   - Provides insights into database security best practices.

### 4. **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**
   - Scripts for managing transactions with `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT`.
   - Ensures database integrity and handles transaction management effectively.

### 5. **Stored Procedures and Triggers**
   - A variety of stored procedures to encapsulate business logic and automation in the database.
   - Includes examples of triggers that respond to specific database events like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.
